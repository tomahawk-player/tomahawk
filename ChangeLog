Version 0.1.0:
    * SOCKS5 proxy support. Noproxy hosts are also supported but no wildcard
      support (yet).
    * Fix issue where track resolving spinner never stopped if tracks were
      removed from playlist while resolving.
    * Twitter & Jabber profile pictures are shown.
    * Fix issues with stations where multiple tracks could be added at once.
    * Allow multiple accounts of the same type.
    * Add new Google account type that is a thin wrapper around a Jabber plugin.
    * Overhaul the settings dialog interface.
    * Resolvers can now be enabled and disabled, and some can be configured
      directly in Tomahawk.
    * Split playlists and stations in sources sidebar. Show Recently Played
      as a node under the Super Collection.
    * Fix massive speed bottleneck on startup in the case of many recently
      played playlists.
    * Browse and play collections in our snappy tree-mode, which also shows
      images for artists and albums.
    * Fixed crash that could occur when playing a track from a browser.
    * Fixed a crash caused by sources going on- or offline.
    * (OS X) Open configuration dialogs as sliding sheets.
    * (OS X) Increase our available file watches to the maximum that the system
      reports.

Version 0.0.3:
    * Show spinner while resolving playlists.
    * Go back to previous page visible when deleting a playlist.
    * Fixed issue where automatic playlists and station summaries were not
      updated in the playlist header.
    * Fixed an issue which caused duplicate items when rescanning.
    * Revert change introduced in 0.0.2 causing Twitter protocol to not try
      to reconnect to a peer if it couldn't connect the first time the plugin
      was connected. This caused confusing (and for most unwanted) behavior.
    * Fix crashes in Twitter authentication.
    * Properly honor the chosen port number if a static host and port are
      marked as preferred.
    * Don't automatically try to resolve all incoming playback logs. This
      speeds up importing sources a lot.
    * Faster painting of playlists with lots of unresolved tracks.
    * Prefer local results when results' score is equal.
    * (Windows) The tomahawk:// protocol handler works on Windows now.
    * (Windows) Fixed launching Tomahawk from Windows installer with admin privileges.

      but the Jabber settings haven't changed.
    * Don't run a rescan of the local collection if the settings dialog is
      closed successfully but the path hasn't changed.
    * Don't attempt to connect to unavailable Twitter peers over and over.
    * Find Twitter peers if the peer's Got Tomahawk? tweet is not their latest
      tweet.
    * Got Tomahawk? tweets can now be sent directly to specific users or in
      private direct messages.
    * Display a helpful message when someone sends a normal instant message to
      the Tomahawk XMPP presence.
    * Incompatible change: Twitter SIP protocol has changed slightly. 0.0.1
      clients will not be able to talk to newer clients.
    * Don't let long playlist or summary names force a large Tomahawk window.
    * Tomahawk now asks you to authorize new contacts.
